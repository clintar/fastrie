Quick and ugly hack to generate the offset-and-difficulty
plot of Riecoin mining progress.  Warning:  It really is
a silly and inefficient way of getting the data and
someone should rewrite it.  It takes quite a while when
starting from scratch.

The first time you run it, you may have to manually set
the START variable to zero in the .sh scripts.

To run:
1)  Update the path to your riecoind in getdiffs.sh and getoffsets.sh

2)  Run:
  ./getoffsets.sh >> blocks_trimmed
  ./getdiffs.sh >> diffs.txt

3) Create logscale version of offets
  ./blocklog.py > block_logs.txt

4) Create plot
  gnuplot graph.gnuplot
